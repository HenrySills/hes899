#Thoughts on importance of ethics
1. Intellectual property is very important since it is your work or someone else's that needs to be credited.  
2. Honesty is also very important because if a developer is not honest with their work, they would be able to manipulate things based on their software that they were not honest about.
3. Developers should be well aware of the people and things affected by their work.
